## Microservices Architecture

The application is divided into the following microservices:

1. **User Service**: Handles user registration, authentication, and profile management.
2. **Product Service**: Manages product catalog, categories, and inventory.
3. **Cart Service**: Manages shopping cart functionality.
4. **Order Service**: Handles order creation, payment processing, and order tracking.
5. **Payment Service**: Integrates with third-party payment gateways.
6. **Notification Service**: Sends emails, SMS, or push notifications.
7. **Recommendation Service**: Provides product recommendations.
8. **API Gateway**: Acts as a single entry point for all client requests.
9. **Service Discovery**: Uses Netflix Eureka for service registration and discovery.
10. **Config Server**: Centralized configuration management using Spring Cloud Config.

## Industry Design Patterns

This project implements the following **industry-standard design patterns**:

### 1. **Layered Architecture**
   - **Controller Layer**: Handles HTTP requests and responses.
   - **Service Layer**: Contains business logic and interacts with repositories.
   - **Repository Layer**: Manages data access and database interactions.

### 2. **Microservices Architecture**
   - **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**: Each microservice is responsible for a single business capability.
   - **Decentralized Data Management**: Each service has its own database, ensuring loose coupling.

### 3. **API Gateway Pattern**
   - The **API Gateway** acts as a single entry point for all client requests, routing them to the appropriate microservices.

### 4. **Service Discovery**
   - **Netflix Eureka** is used for service registration and discovery, enabling dynamic scaling and load balancing.

### 5. **Circuit Breaker Pattern**
   - **Resilience4j** is used to handle failures gracefully and prevent cascading failures in distributed systems.

### 6. **Saga Pattern**
   - The **Saga Pattern** is used to manage distributed transactions (e.g., order creation involving multiple services).

### 7. **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)**
   - Separates read and write operations for better scalability and performance.

### 8. **Event Sourcing**
   - Stores the state of a business entity as a sequence of events, enabling auditability and replayability.
